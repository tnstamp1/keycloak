# Keycloak Auth Server Docker image with Examples

This image prepares a basic Keycloak Auth Server and deploys the examples.

## Usage

To boot in standalone mode

    docker run jboss/keycloak-examples
    
The user and password to be used to access the Keycloak Admin console can be passed as env variable when you request the creation of the docker process
       
    docker run -e KEYCLOAK_USER=admin -e KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD=admin jboss/keycloak-examples
       
Once it boots, you can login using admin/admin for the first login on the [Auth server](http://localhost:8080/auth/admin/) or as bburke@redhat.com/password on the [Customer Portal sample application](http://localhost:8080/customer-portal/customers/view.jsp).

Remark : Domain mode is not supported on this version, as this image ships with a custom standalone.xml file.

## Other details

This image inherits from the main [Keycloak Auth Server image](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/jboss/keycloak/) and deploys the examples, including the test realm used by them. 

You should not inherit from this image, as it includes a realm that is intended only for testing. If you want to reuse the bits from this image, use the [keycloak image](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/jboss/keycloak/).
